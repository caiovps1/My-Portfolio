# Data Science Portfolio by Caio Villar

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for practicing data analysis, data visualization and for exploration of machine learning algorithms. Each category represents a different type of project.


## Dataquest's Guided Projects

Coming from an electrical engineering background, I started my data science journey on **[Dataquest](https://dataquest.io "Dataquest's homepage")**. Dataquest's main focus is to teach aspiring data scientists by coding, and to do this, each different lesson page has its own coding exercises. There are guided projects at the end of some courses, in which we can practice the new knowledge all together. Here, we can see some of these guided projects, each one of them showing a different set of skills acquired.

### Profitable Free App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

As one of my first guided projects, the main goal of this one to practice pure **Python** skills. Based on the fictional situation of working a new tech company that develops mobile apps for Android and IOS, our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of free apps are likely to attract more users. This project is written in portuguese (native language). The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/Profitable-Free-App-Profiles/blob/master/project.ipynb).

### Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data

In this guided project, the main goal is to practice data cleaning and initial data exploring with **pandas**. The dataset to be cleaned and analyzed has Ebay Car Sales Data from Ebay Germany, and it was edited by Dataquest's team to match more realistically a web scraped dataset. The columns, when strings, are written in german. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/Ebay-Car-Sales/blob/master/project.ipynb).

### Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees

The main goal of this guided project is to practice data vizualization using **matplotlib**. The project itself is pretty straight forward and contains a lot of graphs. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/College-Gender-Gap/blob/master/project.ipynb).

### Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

In this guided project, I practice my data cleaning and data analysis skills working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

We analyze the data and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/Employee-Exit-Survey/blob/master/project.ipynb).

### Answering Business Questions using SQLite

In this guided project, the main goal is to use **SQL** skills to answer business questions. The database used is the Chinook database, which contains data from a fictional music store. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/Business-Questions-SQL/blob/master/project.ipynb).


### Predicting Car Prices using KNN

Although this project is at Dataquest's guided projects section, it is actually only based out of one. The main goal in this project is to predict car prices using the k-Nearest Neighbors Regressor. The libraries used are: **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib** and **scikit-learn**. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/KNN-Predicting-Car-Prices).

## Kaggle Competitions

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This competition from Kaggle is recommended for beginners to practice ML skills, going from exploring the data, getting insights and then making predictions. It was my job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. This was my first contact with Kaggle, a great website for Data Scientists. The libraries used are: **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **scikit-learn**, and my final score (until now) is **78,47%** accuracy, obtained from a  **Random Forest** model. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/caiovps1/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/master/project.ipynb).
